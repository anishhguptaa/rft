# REASONING INSTRUCTIONS

Before generating the workout plan, systematically analyze and think through:

1. **Fitness Assessment**: Evaluate the user's current fitness level based on experience level, age, and stated limitations
2. **Goal Analysis**: Break down the primary goal into measurable, achievable milestones over the {goal_timeline}-week timeline
3. **Equipment Optimization**: Select exercises that maximize effectiveness with the available equipment
4. **Progressive Overload**: Design a progression strategy that increases intensity by 5-10% weekly while respecting recovery needs
5. **Safety Integration**: Ensure all exercises are safe given the user's limitations and experience level
6. **User Remarks Integration**: Carefully consider any additional user remarks and adapt the workout plan accordingly (e.g., specific equipment limitations, preferences, or constraints)
7. **Recovery Balance**: Structure workouts to allow adequate recovery between sessions
8. **Mid-Week Adaptation**: Since user is starting on {current_day}, adapt the workout plan accordingly

# MID-WEEK STARTING INSTRUCTIONS

**CRITICAL**: The user is starting their workout plan on {current_day} (day {current_day_index_plus_one} of the week).

**Adaptation Rules:**
- Generate workouts for the remaining {remaining_days} days of this week only
- Focus on FULL BODY workouts for the first few sessions to help the user's body adapt
- Reduce intensity for the first week to prevent overexertion and injury
- Prioritize movement patterns and form over heavy loads or high volume
- Include more mobility and activation exercises in the initial sessions

**Full Body Focus Strategy:**
- Each workout should target all major muscle groups (upper body, lower body, core)
- Use compound movements that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously
- Include activation exercises to prepare the body for future workouts
- Emphasize proper form and movement patterns over intensity

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

<output_requirements>
  <format>Structured JSON matching WorkoutPlanResponse schema exactly</format>
  <exercise_count>6-8 exercises per workout day (optimal for {experience_level} level)</exercise_count>

# GENERATION TASK

Generate a comprehensive, personalized workout plan that includes:

1. **Overview**: Brief summary of THIS WEEK'S workout plan, expected outcomes, user limitations considered, and key training principles. Focus on the adaptation phase since user is starting mid-week.

2. **Routines**: List of workout routines for the remaining {remaining_days} days starting from {current_day}
   - Each routine should be FULL BODY focused for adaptation
   - Include activation and mobility exercises
   - Emphasize proper form over intensity
   - Each routine should have a unique name (e.g., "Full Body Day 1", "Full Body Day 2")

3. **Weekly Schedule**: Day-by-day breakdown for the remaining {remaining_days} days starting from {current_day}
   - Each day should reference a routine from the routines list
   - Include day_of_week and routine_name for each day

4. **Exercise Details**: For each exercise, provide:
   - Exercise name (specific and clear)
   - Sets and reps (with progression over {goal_timeline} weeks)
   - Weights used (appropriate for experience level)
   - Difficulty level (matching user's {experience_level} level)
   - Equipment needed (MUST be exactly "{equipment}" - not "bodyweight" or other variations)
   - Form tips (specific, actionable guidance)

**CRITICAL EQUIPMENT RULES:**
- If equipment is "home_bodyweight": Use ONLY bodyweight exercises, equipment field = "home_bodyweight"
- If equipment is "home_dumbbells": Use ONLY dumbbell exercises, equipment field = "home_dumbbells"  
- If equipment is "gym": Use gym equipment, equipment field = "gym"

**CRITICAL LIMITATION RULES:**
- If user has knee_injury: Use seated, lying, or isometric exercises instead of squats/lunges
- If user has lower_back_pain: Use supported, seated, or lying exercises instead of squats/deadlifts
- If user has shoulder_impingement: Use neutral grip, seated, or supported exercises instead of overhead movements

**USER REMARKS INTEGRATION:**
- Carefully read and incorporate any user remarks: {user_remarks}
- If user mentions specific equipment limitations (e.g., "only have 5kg and 10kg dumbbells"), ensure ALL dumbbell exercises use only those weights
- If user mentions preferences or constraints, adapt the workout plan accordingly
- If user mentions time constraints, adjust workout duration and complexity
- If user mentions specific goals or concerns, address them in exercise selection and progression

4. **AI Summary**: Detailed summary of this week's workout plan that will be used as reference for generating next week's plan. Include:
   - Key exercises performed
   - Intensity levels used
   - Progression patterns established
   - Areas of focus for the week
   - Notes on user adaptation and any modifications made
   - Recommendations for next week's plan

**SCHEMA COMPLIANCE:**
- Each exercise must have a "reps" array with specific numbers (e.g., [10, 12, 8]) not ranges
- Each exercise must have a "weights_used" array with weights in kilograms for each set
- Ensure proper nesting: WorkoutPlanResponse -> routines -> exercises -> reps/weights_used
- Ensure proper nesting: WorkoutPlanResponse -> weekly_schedule -> DailySchedule

Ensure the response follows the WorkoutPlanResponse schema structure with proper nesting and field names.

# FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

Systematically evaluate the following aspects:

## 1. WEIGHT CHANGE FEASIBILITY
- **Weight Loss**: Maximum safe rate is 0.5-1.5 kg per week (0.5-1.5% of body weight)
- **Weight Gain**: Maximum safe rate is 0.5-0.75 kg per week for muscle gain
- **BMI Considerations**: Ensure target weight results in healthy BMI range (18.5-24.9)
- **Gender Differences**: Account for different metabolic rates and body composition between genders

## 2. TIMELINE REALISM
- **Beginner Level**: Allow 2-4 weeks for adaptation before significant progress
- **Intermediate Level**: Expect steady progress after 1-2 weeks
- **Advanced Level**: May see faster initial progress but diminishing returns
- **Age Factor**: Older adults (50+) may need longer adaptation periods

## 3. GOAL-SPECIFIC FEASIBILITY
- **Weight Loss**: Requires 500-1000 calorie daily deficit
- **Muscle Gain**: Requires progressive overload + caloric surplus + adequate protein
- **Strength**: Requires consistent progressive overload over 8-12 weeks minimum
- **Endurance**: Requires gradual cardiovascular progression

## 4. EQUIPMENT CONSTRAINTS
- **home_bodyweight**: Limited to bodyweight exercises, may restrict certain goals
- **home_dumbbells**: Good for most goals but limited progression potential
- **gym**: Full equipment access enables optimal goal achievement

## 5. MEDICAL & SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
- **Injuries**: Assess if limitations prevent safe goal achievement
- **Age-Related**: Consider joint health, recovery capacity, and mobility
- **Experience Level**: Ensure goals match realistic progression for skill level

## 6. FREQUENCY ANALYSIS
- **Recovery**: Ensure adequate rest between sessions
- **Progression**: Assess if frequency supports goal achievement

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

You must provide your response in the exact RequestFeasibilityResponse format with these three fields:

1. **feasibility**: One of: "FEASIBLE", or "NOT_FEASIBLE"
2. **feasibility_reasoning**: Detailed explanation of your assessment (20-40 words)
3. **feasibility_recommendations**: Specific recommendations for the user (20-50 words)

# CRITICAL SAFETY RULES

- **Weight Loss**: Never recommend more than 1.5 kg/week weight loss
- **Weight Gain**: Never recommend more than 0.75 kg/week weight gain
- **Injury Limitations**: If limitations prevent safe goal achievement, mark as NOT_FEASIBLE
- **Age Considerations**: Older adults (60+) require more conservative timelines
- **Beginner Limitations**: Beginners need longer adaptation periods
- **Medical Conditions**: Any serious medical conditions require medical clearance
