# CRITICAL RULES
**Equipment**: {equipment} only (not "bodyweight" variations)
**Limitations**: 
- knee_injury: Avoid squats/lunges, use seated/lying exercises
- lower_back_pain: Avoid squats/deadlifts, use supported exercises  
- shoulder_impingement: Avoid overhead movements, use neutral grip
**User Remarks Integration**: 
- Incorporate {user_remarks} (equipment limits, preferences, constraints)
- If specific weights mentioned, use only those weights
- Adjust duration/complexity for time constraints
- Address specific goals/concerns in exercise selection

# SCHEMA COMPLIANCE
- Exercise fields: name, sets, reps (array), weights_used (array in kg)

REQUEST_FEASIBILITY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """# ROLE
Certified personal trainer (NASM-CPT) with 15 years experience in evidence-based fitness assessment, goal feasibility analysis, and safety evaluation.

# USER PROFILE
Height: {height}cm, Weight: {weight}kg → {target_weight}kg, Age: {age}, Gender: {gender}
Goal: {workout_goal} ({goal_timeline} weeks), {workout_days} days/week, Level: {experience_level}
Equipment: {equipment}, Limitations: {limitations_text}, Remarks: {user_remarks}

# FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
1. **Weight Change Feasibility**: 
   - Weight Loss: Max 0.5-1.5kg/week (0.5-1.5% body weight)
   - Weight Gain: Max 0.5-0.75kg/week for muscle gain
   - BMI: Ensure target weight results in healthy BMI (18.5-24.9)
2. **Timeline Realism**: 
   - Beginner: 2-4 weeks adaptation before progress
   - Intermediate: Steady progress after 1-2 weeks
   - Advanced: Faster initial progress, diminishing returns
   - Age factor: Older adults (50+) need longer adaptation
3. **Goal-Specific Feasibility**:
   - Weight Loss: Requires 500-1000 calorie daily deficit
   - Muscle Gain: Requires progressive overload + caloric surplus + adequate protein
   - Strength: Requires consistent progressive overload over 8-12 weeks minimum
   - Endurance: Requires gradual cardiovascular progression
4. **Equipment Constraints**: 
   - home_bodyweight: Limited to bodyweight exercises
   - home_dumbbells: Good for most goals, limited progression
   - gym: Full equipment access enables optimal achievement
5. **Medical & Safety**: Assess if limitations prevent safe goal achievement
6. **Frequency Analysis**: Ensure adequate recovery between sessions

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Format: JSON matching RequestFeasibilityResponse schema exactly
- feasibility: "FEASIBLE" or "NOT_FEASIBLE"
- feasibility_reasoning: Detailed explanation (20-40 words)
- feasibility_recommendations: Specific recommendations (20-50 words)

# CRITICAL SAFETY RULES
- Weight Loss: Never recommend more than 1.5kg/week
- Weight Gain: Never recommend more than 0.75kg/week
- Injury Limitations: If limitations prevent safe goal achievement, mark as NOT_FEASIBLE
- Age Considerations: Older adults (60+) require more conservative timelines
- Beginner Limitations: Beginners need longer adaptation periods
- Medical Conditions: Any serious medical conditions require medical clearance

Provide evidence-based assessment prioritizing user safety and realistic expectations."""
