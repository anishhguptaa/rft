# REASONING INSTRUCTIONS

Before generating the workout plan, systematically analyze and think through:

1. **Fitness Assessment**: Evaluate the user's current fitness level based on experience level, age, and stated limitations
2. **Goal Analysis**: Break down the primary goal into measurable, achievable milestones over the {data['goal_timeline']}-week timeline
3. **Equipment Optimization**: Select exercises that maximize effectiveness with the available equipment
4. **Progressive Overload**: Design a progression strategy that increases intensity by 5-10% weekly while respecting recovery needs
5. **Safety Integration**: Ensure all exercises are safe given the user's limitations and experience level
6. **Recovery Balance**: Structure workouts to allow adequate recovery between sessions
7. **Mid-Week Adaptation**: Since user is starting on {data['current_day']}, adapt the workout plan accordingly

# MID-WEEK STARTING INSTRUCTIONS

**CRITICAL**: The user is starting their workout plan on {data['current_day']} (day {current_day_index + 1} of the week).

**Adaptation Rules:**
- Generate workouts for the remaining {remaining_days} days of this week only
- Focus on FULL BODY workouts for the first few sessions to help the user's body adapt
- Reduce intensity for the first week to prevent overexertion and injury
- Prioritize movement patterns and form over heavy loads or high volume
- Include more mobility and activation exercises in the initial sessions

**Full Body Focus Strategy:**
- Each workout should target all major muscle groups (upper body, lower body, core)
- Use compound movements that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously
- Include activation exercises to prepare the body for future workouts
- Emphasize proper form and movement patterns over intensity

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

  <format>Structured JSON matching WorkoutPlanResponse schema exactly</format>
  <exercise_count>6-8 exercises per workout day (optimal for {data['experience_level']} level)</exercise_count>
  <safety_mandate>All recommendations must account for user_limitations: {limitations_text}</safety_mandate>
  <progression_rule>Weekly intensity increases of 5-10% maximum</progression_rule>
  <equipment_constraint>Only use exercises compatible with: {data['equipment']}</equipment_constraint>

# VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing your response, verify:
✓ All exercises use only the specified equipment: {data['equipment']}
✓ Equipment field must EXACTLY match: {data['equipment']} (not "bodyweight" but "{data['equipment']}")
✓ Total workout duration aligns with {data['experience_level']} experience level (45-75 minutes)
✓ NO exercises conflict with stated limitations: {limitations_text}
✓ For knee_injury: AVOID squats, lunges, jumps, step-ups, wall sits
✓ For lower_back_pain: AVOID squats, deadlifts, bent-over rows, good mornings
✓ For shoulder_impingement: AVOID overhead presses, lateral raises, upright rows, pull-ups
✓ Progressive overload is clearly defined with specific weekly increases
✓ Exercise selection supports the primary goal: {data['workout_goal']}
✓ Rest periods are appropriate for the user's experience level
✓ Form tips are specific and actionable for each exercise
✓ Workout plan covers remaining {remaining_days} days starting from {data['current_day']}
✓ Each workout is full body focused for adaptation

# GENERATION TASK

Generate a comprehensive, personalized workout plan that includes:

1. **Overview**: Brief summary of THIS WEEK'S workout plan, expected outcomes, user limitations considered, and key training principles. Focus on the adaptation phase since user is starting mid-week.

2. **Weekly Schedule**: Day-by-day breakdown for the remaining {remaining_days} days starting from {data['current_day']}
   - Each day should be FULL BODY focused for adaptation
   - Include activation and mobility exercises
   - Emphasize proper form over intensity

3. **Exercise Details**: For each exercise, provide:
   - Exercise name (specific and clear)
   - Sets and reps (with progression over {data['goal_timeline']} weeks)
   - Rest periods (appropriate for experience level)
   - Difficulty level (matching user's {data['experience_level']} level)
   - Equipment needed (MUST be exactly "{data['equipment']}" - not "bodyweight" or other variations)
   - Form tips (specific, actionable guidance)

**CRITICAL EQUIPMENT RULES:**
- If equipment is "home_bodyweight": Use ONLY bodyweight exercises, equipment field = "home_bodyweight"
- If equipment is "home_dumbbells": Use ONLY dumbbell exercises, equipment field = "home_dumbbells"  
- If equipment is "gym": Use gym equipment, equipment field = "gym"

**CRITICAL LIMITATION RULES:**
- If user has knee_injury: Use seated, lying, or isometric exercises instead of squats/lunges
- If user has lower_back_pain: Use supported, seated, or lying exercises instead of squats/deadlifts
- If user has shoulder_impingement: Use neutral grip, seated, or supported exercises instead of overhead movements

4. **Summary**: Detailed summary of this week's workout plan that will be used as reference for generating next week's plan. Include:
   - Key exercises performed
   - Intensity levels used
   - Progression patterns established
   - Areas of focus for the week
   - Notes on user adaptation and any modifications made
   - Recommendations for next week's plan

**SCHEMA COMPLIANCE:**
- Each exercise must have a "reps" array with Reps objects containing "weight_used" and "number_of_reps"
- The "number_of_reps" field in Reps must be a specific number (e.g., "10", "12") not a range
- Ensure proper nesting: WorkoutPlanResponse -> WeeklySchedule -> WorkoutDay -> Exercise -> Reps

Ensure the response follows the WorkoutPlanResponse schema structure with proper nesting and field names.
